# Delay-Player-Metronome

A handy tool I made to make practicing bass guitar more convinent.

Right now I believe it only works on windows keyboard (further test on other OS can be done in the future), it triggers the play key a few seconds after turning on the player to play the background soundtrack, so I have time to take my hand back from the laptop onto my instrument and get ready.

It also comes with a metronome which starts playing with the soundtrack.

The sound effect for the metronome was downloaded elsewhere and I don't think I have the permission to upload it here, so when using it please source your own soundeffect and change the directory in the file.
